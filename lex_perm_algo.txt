//Values at all positions are noted 
//Everytime the right string changes, the position values are reset


//Traverse list of numbers
//Marker starts at second right most position in the string and stores value of this index
//Parent algorithm checks for the smallest number which has not already been in this position
//Whats the next smallest number that can go in that position that hasnt already been in that position
//Base case two-digtit numbers: Its easy to order 79 -> 97 etc
//The left substring needs to stay constant until the right substring has gone through all permutations
//The marker is then moved to the next
